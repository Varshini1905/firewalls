# üîí Linux Firewall Configuration: Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will help you configure the Ubuntu firewall to block and test inbound Telnet traffic on port 23 using `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall).

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Terminal

You can open the terminal by:

- Searching for **"Terminal"** in the application menu  
**OR**  
- Pressing **Ctrl + Alt + T**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Current Firewall Rules

To check the status and see the currently configured firewall rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
To block TCP traffic on port 23 (commonly used for Telnet):

```bash
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
```
-----

4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Telnet Client (If Not Already Installed)
If telnet is not installed on your system, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install telnet -y
```
---
5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Rule by Attempting to Connect to Port 23
Try connecting to port 23 locally to verify the block:

```bash
telnet localhost 23
```
‚úÖ You should receive a connection failed message, which confirms that the port is successfully blocked.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Allow SSH Access (Port 22)
To ensure that SSH remains accessible:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```
üîê This is important if you're accessing the system remotely via SSH.
